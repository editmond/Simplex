# Simplex
What is Simplex?
The Simplex application aims to be an intuitive graphical text editor with some fea-
tures of an IDE. It will be able to directly alter source files and compile or run them with
a simple user input.

Why was this made?
This project was made in 2024 as major work for the Software Design and Development course for stage 6 HSC (New South Wales, Australia).
This meant that not only was a working prototype required, but documentation that was taught as part of the course was also required.
Documentation and the design process can be found in the documentation folder.
The syllabus, documentation and the design process can be found in the documentation folder of this repository.
The course was discontinued after the 2024 class.
